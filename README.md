Overview

This project contains the analysis of two separate datasets:

London Bike Hires and COVID-19 Restrictions: This analysis investigates the effects of three COVID-19 policies on the number of bike rentals in London. The policies include "Work From Home," "Rule of 6 Indoors," and the "Eat Out to Help Out" scheme.
E-Book Sales: This analysis evaluates the impact of average review scores, total number of reviews, and sale price on e-book sales. Additionally, it explores whether the sale price effect differs across book genres.
The assignment is completed using RMarkdown and submitted as an HTML file along with the RMarkdown source file. The objective is to produce a professional, reproducible, and easy-to-follow report that showcases the statistical analyses and results.
